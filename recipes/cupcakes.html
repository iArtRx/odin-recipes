        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="step">To make this cupcake recipe, preheat the oven to 170°C.</li>
            <li class="step">Put the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and butter in a freestanding electric mixer with a paddle attachment (or use a handheld electric whisk) and beat on slow speed until you get a sandy consistency and everything is combined. Gradually pour in half the milk and beat until the milk is just incorporated.</li>
            <li class="step">Whisk the egg, vanilla extract and remaining milk together in a separate bowl for a few seconds, then pour into the flour mixture and continue beating until just incorporated (scrape any unmixed ingredients from the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula). Continue mixing for a couple more minutes until the mixture is smooth. Do not overmix.</li>
            <li class="step">Spoon the mixture into the paper cases until two-thirds full and bake in the preheated oven for 18–20 minutes, or until light golden and the sponge bounces back when touched.</li>
            <li class="step">A skewer inserted in the centre should come out clean. Leave the cupcakes to cool slightly in the tray before turning out onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li class="step">When the cupcakes are cold, spoon the vanilla frosting on top and decorate with hundreds and thousands.</li>
            <li class="step">Beat the icing sugar and butter together in a freestanding electric mixer with a paddle attachment (or use a handheld electric whisk) on medium-slow speed until the mixture comes together and is well mixed.</li>
            <li class="step">Turn the mixer down to slow speed. Combine the milk and vanilla extract in a separate bowl, then add to the butter mixture a couple of tablespoons at a time. Once all the milk has been incorporated, turn the mixer up to high speed.</li>
            <li class="step">Continue beating until the frosting is light and fluffy, at least 5 minutes. The longer the frosting is beaten, the fluffier and lighter it becomes.</li>
        </ol>
